<p><b>The Swarm</b> is a French horror film directed by Just Philippot and currently showing on Netflix.</p>

<p>It tells the story of a mother struggling to make a success of a locust farm following the suicide of her husband. Desperate to make ends meet, she discovers that feeding blood to the locusts makes them produce more quickly, yielding a more robust crop.  But as the locusts get a taste for blood, things start to spin out of control.</p>

<p><b>The Swarm</b> isn’t a great film.</p>

<p>I should put that out there before continuing with this review. Do not go into this film expecting a cinematic masterpiece. It is not that. But in the genre of animal horror, specifically insect horror, a film doesn’t really need to be great to be good.</p>

<p>The bar is kind of low.</p>

<p>The saving grace for this film is the commitment of its leads. Suliane Brahim does an amazing job portraying a mother on the edge trying to make enough money to support her family, whilst grappling with the fallout of her husband’s suicide.
  Sofian Khammes is a great support, playing the pining lover in the shadows, too blinded by his feelings to make the right call once he discovers what is going on in the locust farm.</p>

<p>Locusts are incredibly creepy insects. It doesn’t take a lot to make them frightening, but <b>The Swarm</b> does manage to make those little critters even more off-putting. There is a particular scene towards the end of the film where the daughter discovers what her mother is doing that was so creepy and disturbing it actually made me cringe.</p>

<p>But scenes like that are far and few between in <b>The Swarm</b>. For a film about blood-thirsty locusts, it is a surprisingly-gore-free film. I expected to see mutilated corpses and half-eaten people abound, but the camera more often than not pans away when a scene is becoming bloody.
  This decision might have been made to make the few gory scenes more shocking, but it ultimately makes <b>The Swarm</b> feel more like a film about grief and locust farming than a horror.</p>

<p>The film doesn’t handle grief well enough to place it in the same category as <b>The Babadook</b> and <b>Midsommar</b>, and so it seems to struggle to define itself.</p>

<p>Is it a horror? Is it a tragedy? Is it a film about the ins and outs of locust farming? The viewer doesn’t know and neither does <b>The Swarm</b>.</p>
